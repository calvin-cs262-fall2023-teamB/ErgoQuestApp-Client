## About ErgoQuest
ErgoQuest is a company that builds zero-gravity workstations for people with back issues and other physical disabilities, allowing them to continue working with minimal pain. ErgoQuest builds both chairs and workstations for their clients. 

## The Problem
Currently, ErgoQuest's chairs are controlled either using simple switches for each motor in the chair, or using an app. The switches have limited functionality, and cannot be programmed for setting preset positions. The app has buttons for manual control and preset functionality, but the user interface leaves much to be desired, and there are missing features.

The most important missing feature is the ability to set the chair to switch between preset positions at set time intervals. This is a feature that has been requested by many clients. These clients need to reposition their body periodically to avoid bed sores and circulation issues. Currently, they have to remember to either manually adjust the chair with the switches, or select the different presets on the app.

## The Solution
We will design a new app for ErgoQuest to control their zero-gravity chairs. This app will include all the features from the old app (manual chair controls, preset positions, BlueTooth connection to the chair's motors, ability to customize the naming of the motors) with an improved user interface that's appealing and easy to use for those with disabilities, and increased functionality with the ability to set the chair to automatically switch between selectable preset positions at customizable time intervals.
